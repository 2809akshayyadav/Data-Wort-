                  <p class="gray">For the past 14 years, I've worked with numerous Salesforce Consulting partners, from
                    very small, boutique style to very big traditional partners (big 5). Girikon has been by far the
                    best partner I've worked so far. They are very receptive, responsive, highly knowledgeable,
                    technical and very quick to address issues to find agreeable solutions. Their cost and value has no
                    comparison in the industry. I highly recommend them and give them a 5 star.</p>
